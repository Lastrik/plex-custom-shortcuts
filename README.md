# DEPRECATED
I need to make it work with the newest plex web player so for now this user script is deprecated

# plex custom shortcuts
This userscript allows you to use custom shortcuts in plex

# How to use
In order to add your own custom shortcuts, you need to add them in the file "plex-custom-shortcuts.user.js" according to the documentation inside the file.

# Default shortcuts
There are already a few shortcuts enabled by default that you can delete if you want to. They are :

| Shortcut		| Action        	|
| -------------	| -----------------	|
| 	f       	| Toggle fullscreen |
| 	k			| Toggle play/pause	|
| double click	| Toggle fullscreen	|
